# Community Strategy

> **Status:** Active
> **Philosophy:** Async-first, searchable-first.

## Communication Channels

### 1. GitHub Discussions (Primary)
**Purpose:** Q&A, feature requests, long-form ideas, "Show and Tell".
**Why:** Indexed by search engines, durable knowledge, linkable.
**Categories:**
- 💡 **Ideas:** RFCs and proposals.
- 🙏 **Q&A:** Support questions (convert issues to discussions).
- 🙌 **Show and Tell:** Share your agent/policy patterns.

### 2. Discord (Secondary)
**Purpose:** Real-time chat, "watercooler", community bonding, rapid debugging.
**Why:** High engagement, lower barrier to entry for casual chat.
**Channels:**
- `#announcements` (Read-only, release notes)
- `#general` (Chat)
- `#support` (Community help)
- `#contributing` (Dev coordination)

## Governance

### Roles
- **User:** Anyone using Assay.
- **Contributor:** Someone who has merged a PR or consistently helps others.
- **Maintainer:** Triage rights, commit access (after sustained contribution).

### Code of Conduct
We adhere to the [Contributor Covenant 2.1](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/code_of_conduct/).
Violations should be reported to `safety@assay.dev` (or private DM to maintainers).

## "Help Wanted" Strategy
We label issues with `good first issue` and `help wanted`.
- `good first issue`: Self-contained, limited scope, mentorship available.
- `help wanted`: We need it, but core team is busy.

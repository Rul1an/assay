**Subject:** Quick question about your Assay experience

Hi [Name],

I noticed you've been using Assay for [Duration/Project]. I'm trying to understand how to make it better for developers like you.

Could you answer 3 quick questions? (No wrong answers!)

1. **The "Aha!" Moment:** At what point did you realize Assay was actually going to be useful for you? (Was it a specific command, finding, or concept?)
2. **The Friction:** What almost stopped you from using Assay? (Docs, installation, error messages?)
3. **The Alternative:** If you couldn't use Assay, what would you use instead? (Manual scripts, another tool, nothing?)

Thanks,
[Your Name]

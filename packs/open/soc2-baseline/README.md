# SOC2 Baseline Pack (Common Criteria)

**ID**: `soc2-baseline`
**Version**: `1.0.0`
**Author**: Assay Project

## Overview
This pack provides a set of **Evidence Invariants** that map to the AICPA Trust Services Criteria (TSC) for Security (Common Criteria).

It DOES NOT verify the effectiveness of your controls. Instead, it verifies the **presence, completeness, and integrity of the evidence** generated by your controls.

## Disclaimer
> [!IMPORTANT]
> This pack is for **evidence gathering** purposes only. Passing these checks does not constitute SOC2 compliance or an audit opinion. It confirms that your CI/CD pipeline is generating the *minimum viable evidence* required to support an audit.

## Mapped Criteria
| Rule ID | TSC Reference | Description |
|---------|--------------|-------------|
| `invariant.accountability` | CC6.1 | Ensures systems/artifacts are registered in the inventory (Accountability). |
| `invariant.change_lifecycle` | CC7.2 | Ensures change events have matching start/finish pairs (Completeness). |
| `invariant.decision_record` | CC8.1 | Ensures automated policy decisions (gates) are recorded (Audit Trail). |

## Usage
```bash
# Lint a bundle against SOC2 requirements
assay evidence lint --bundle my-bundle.tar.gz --pack soc2-baseline
```

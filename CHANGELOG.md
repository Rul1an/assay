# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Trust Compiler

- **P2a MCP companion pack (`mcp-signal-followup`)**: Built-in pack with three rules — **MCP-001** uses pack check `g3_authorization_context_present` (engine **v1.2**), sharing the same predicate as Trust Basis `authorization_context_visible` (verified); **MCP-002** / **MCP-003** cover delegation (`delegated_from`) and containment degradation (`assay.sandbox.degraded`). Open mirror under `packs/open/mcp-signal-followup/`. `assay_min_version: >=3.2.3` tracks the prerequisite line (G3 + Trust Card schema 2; **v3.2.3** is the reference tag for that substrate, not for built-in pack presence); the built-in pack and engine v1.2 ship with the Assay release that contains P2a — state the first tag that embeds the pack in release notes — see [PLAN-P2a](docs/architecture/PLAN-P2a-MCP-SIGNAL-FOLLOWUP-CLAIM-PACK.md).
- **Pack engine v1.2**: Adds `g3_authorization_context_present`; bumps `ENGINE_VERSION` in `assay-evidence` (mandate-baseline rules that declared `engine_min_version: "1.2"` now execute with this engine).
- **T1a Trust Basis Compiler MVP**: Assay now ships a canonical `trust-basis.json` compiler surface on `main`, derived from verified bundles with fixed claim keys, fixed evidence vocabularies, and deterministic regeneration.
- **Low-level trust compiler CLI**: Repository builds now expose `assay trust-basis generate <bundle>` for advanced CI, diffing, and review workflows.
- **G3 Authorization Context Evidence**: Supported MCP tool-call paths can merge policy-projected `auth_scheme`, `auth_issuer`, and `principal` onto `assay.tool.decision` evidence; normalization allowlists schemes, trims issuer, rejects JWS-compact and `Bearer ` credential material, and omits whitespace-only principals.
- **Trust Card schema v2**: Trust Basis emits **seven** claims (adds `authorization_context_visible` between delegation and containment); `trustcard.json` uses `schema_version` **2**. Downstream consumers should select claims by stable `id`, not assume a fixed row count.

### Notes

- **Claim-first boundary**: `T1a` ships claim classification in the compiler layer, not in a Trust Card renderer.
- **Deliberate non-goals**: This wave does not yet ship `trustcard.json`, `trustcard.md`, a trust score, a `safe/unsafe` badge, or new signal/pack/engine semantics.

### MCP Security

- **New MCP integrity metrics**: Added `tool_description_integrity`, `tool_output_valid`, and `tool_collision_detect` to cover tool-definition drift, output-schema contracts, and cross-server tool shadowing.

### Observability

- **Runtime monitor output**: `assay monitor` blocked-file events now print structured `dev`, `ino`, `cgroup`, and `rule_id` fields instead of raw payload text.
- **Ring buffer pressure summary**: `assay monitor` now reports emitted and dropped ring-buffer counters for tracepoint, LSM, and socket monitor paths at the end of a run.
- **Metric evaluation spans**: The runner now emits one `assay.eval.metric` span per metric evaluation with stable fields for latency, cached status, pass/fail, unstable state, and error reporting.

### Supply Chain

- **CycloneDX release asset**: Release builds now publish `assay-${VERSION}-sbom-cyclonedx.tar.gz` and `assay-${VERSION}-sbom-cyclonedx.tar.gz.sha256` alongside the existing binaries.

---

## [v3.2.2] - 2026-03-17

### Fixes

- **crates.io publish**: Exclude assay-adapter-api from publish list (Trusted Publishing not configured). Use 3.1.0 from crates.io.
- **crates.io publish**: Broaden grep pattern for token-not-valid skip.

---

## [v3.2.1] - 2026-03-17

### Fixes

- **Windows build**: Gate `std::os::unix::fs::PermissionsExt` with `#[cfg(unix)]` so the Windows release build succeeds.

---

## [v3.2.0] - 2026-03-17

### Release

- **Cross-platform builds re-enabled**: macOS x86_64, macOS aarch64 (Apple Silicon), and Windows x86_64 are back in the release matrix.
- **Runner updates (March 2026)**: `macos-15` (was macos-14), `windows-2025` (explicit version).
- **Install script**: `curl -fsSL https://getassay.dev/install.sh | sh` now supports macOS ARM.

---

## [v3.1.0] - 2026-03-15

### MCP Policy Enforcement (Wave24–Wave42)

- **Typed decisions + Decision Event v2**: Deterministic typed decision outcomes with structured `DecisionData` payloads replacing stringly-typed fields.
- **Obligation execution**: Runtime execution of `log`, `alert`, `approval_required`, `restrict_scope`, and `redact_args` obligations with deterministic evidence emission.
- **Approval enforcement**: `approval_required` blocks tool calls without valid approval artifacts; approval shape is additive evidence.
- **Restrict scope enforcement**: `restrict_scope` narrows tool-call arguments at runtime with evidence of what was restricted and why.
- **Redact args enforcement**: `redact_args` strips sensitive fields from tool-call arguments before forwarding, with redaction evidence markers.
- **Fulfillment normalization**: Obligation fulfillment outcomes are normalized into a stable contract for downstream consumers.
- **Deny/fail-closed evidence convergence**: Deny paths and fail-closed decisions emit consistent, typed evidence with deterministic precedence.
- **Replay diff basis**: Deterministic replay diff buckets with legacy fallback classification for backward compatibility.
- **Evidence compatibility normalization**: Replay evidence compatibility markers for additive reader contracts.
- **Consumer hardening**: Frozen consumer read precedence for `DecisionEvent`, `DecisionData`, and `ReplayDiffBasis` payloads.
- **Context envelope hardening**: Completeness markers and additive metadata on context-envelope payloads.

### BYOS Evidence Store (ADR-015 Phase 1)

- **`assay evidence store-status`**: New diagnostic command — checks connectivity, credentials, inventory, and write access. Supports JSON, table, and plain output. Exit codes: 0 (OK), 1 (connectivity/access failure), 2 (config error).
- **`.assay/store.yaml` config**: Structured YAML configuration for evidence store connection. Precedence: `--store` > `ASSAY_STORE_URL` > config file. Credentials stay in environment variables.
- **Config fallback for push/pull/list**: `--store` is now optional — falls back to `ASSAY_STORE_URL` or `.assay/store.yaml` automatically.
- **Provider quickstart docs**: AWS S3, Backblaze B2, MinIO setup guides.

### Architecture & Documentation

- Architecture-as-code workspace: Structurizr/C4, building blocks, quality scenarios, Obsidian view layer, catalog metadata.
- ADR-027 through ADR-031 closed as implemented contracts.
- Repo-wide architecture gap analysis and roadmap truth sync.
- Release/changelog hygiene: consolidated to single curated CHANGELOG.md.

### Fixes

- Evidence command dispatch is now async (fixes nested tokio runtime panic for BYOS commands).
- `StoreConfig::discover()` returns errors on malformed config files instead of silently ignoring them.

---

## [v3.0.0] - 2026-03-05

### Breaking API Changes

- `assay_core::mcp::policy::ToolPolicy` adds `allow_classes` and `deny_classes`.
- `assay_core::mcp::decision::DecisionData` adds `tool_classes`, `matched_tool_classes`, `match_basis`, and `matched_rule`.
- External struct-literal construction against these types now requires populating the new fields.

### DX and Runtime

- **Coverage v1.1 polish:** `assay coverage` supports `--out-md` for reviewer-friendly markdown output and `--routes-top` for route summary control while JSON remains canonical (`coverage_report_v1`).
- **MCP coverage/session exports:** `assay mcp wrap` supports `--coverage-out` and `--state-window-out` informational artifacts with stable schemas and explicit write logging.
- **Tool taxonomy governance:** MCP policy evaluation and decision metadata include tool taxonomy class matching (`tool_classes`, `matched_tool_classes`) for broader sink/source governance coverage.

### Governance Contracts and Runbooks

- Added/finalized ADR contract line for taxonomy, coverage, session/state window, and coverage DX polish (ADR-027/028/029/030/031).
- Added operational runbooks for taxonomy+coverage and session/state export usage in enterprise workflows.

## [v2.12.0] - 2026-01-29

### 🔐 Pack Registry: Enterprise-Grade Supply Chain Security

This release introduces the **Pack Registry Client** (`assay-registry` crate) - a complete implementation of SPEC-Pack-Registry-v1.0.3 for secure remote pack distribution.

### ✨ Major Features

-   **Pack Registry Client** (`crates/assay-registry/`):
    -   HTTP client with token + OIDC authentication
    -   Pack resolution: local → bundled → registry → BYOS
    -   Local caching with TOCTOU protection (integrity verified on every read)
    -   Lockfile v2 for reproducible builds (`assay.packs.lock`)

-   **JCS Canonicalization (RFC 8785)**:
    -   Deterministic JSON serialization for pack digests
    -   Uses `serde_jcs::to_vec()` (bytes, not string) to eliminate encoding issues
    -   Canonical digest format: `sha256:{hex}`

-   **Strict YAML Validation (SPEC §6.1)**:
    -   Pre-scan rejects anchors (`&`), aliases (`*`), tags (`!!`), multi-document (`---`)
    -   Duplicate key detection with correct list-item scoping
    -   DoS limits: max depth 50, keys 10k, string 1MB, input 10MB
    -   Integer range checks: ±2^53 (IEEE 754 safe integer)

-   **DSSE Signature Verification**:
    -   Ed25519 + PAE encoding per DSSE spec
    -   Sidecar endpoint (`GET /packs/{name}/{version}.sig`) for large signatures
    -   Client always prefers sidecar over `X-Pack-Signature` header

-   **Trust Model (No-TOFU)**:
    -   Pinned root keys compiled into binary
    -   Key rotation via signed manifest
    -   Pinned roots survive remote revocation attempts
    -   Runtime expiry checks for manifest keys

### 🧪 GitHub Action v2.1 Test Coverage

-   Contract tests for all v2.1 features:
    -   Pack lint with `eu-ai-act-baseline` + SARIF validation
    -   Fork PR SARIF skip logic
    -   OIDC provider auto-detection (AWS/GCP/Azure patterns)
    -   Attestation gating (push-only, default branch, verified)
    -   Coverage calculation formula

### 🐛 Security Fixes (P0)

-   **Duplicate Key Detection**: Pre-scan catches block mapping duplicates; serde_yaml catches flow mapping duplicates
-   **DSSE Verification**: Signature verification uses canonical JCS bytes (not raw YAML)
-   **List-Item Scoping**: Each list item gets its own scope (fixes false positives for `- a: 1\n- a: 2`)

## [v2.2.0] - 2026-01-23

### 🛡️ SOTA Hardening (Jan 2026)

This release delivers "State-of-the-Art" infrastructure hardening, specifically targeting ARM/Self-Hosted stability and CI reliability. It eliminates supply chain risks and ensures deterministic builds across all platforms.

### ✨ Major Features
-   **Robust ARM Infrastructure**: Implemented a "GoFoss -> Ubuntu Ports" failover loop for all ARM runners. This eliminates flaky `404` errors caused by the unstable `ports.ubuntu.com` mirror.
    -   **Generic Logic**: The failover script aggressively rewrites *any* `ubuntu-ports` source, scrubbing legacy/broken mirrors (e.g. `edge.kernel.org`) from self-hosted runners.
    -   **Optimization**: Automatically skips logic on AMD64 runners (`ubuntu-latest`) to preserve "Fast Path" performance.
-   **Intelligent Gating**:
    -   **Fork Safety**: Self-hosted runners are now strictly gated (`if: fork == false`) to prevent malicious code execution from PR forks.
    -   **Split Smoke**: `ebpf-smoke` is split into `-ubuntu` (for signal) and `-self-hosted` (for depth), ensuring forks still get CI feedback.
-   **Performance "Fast Path"**:
    -   **Install-First**: All apt jobs now attempt `install` before `update`, leveraging fresh runner caches for significant speedups.
    -   **Hardened Flags**: Ubiquitous use of `DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive` and `--no-install-recommends`.

### 🐛 Fixes
-   **Artifact Sequencing**: Fixed a race condition in `kernel-matrix.yml` (`matrix-test`) where install scripts ran before artifact download.
-   **Supply Chain**: Enforced `--locked` / pinned versions for all `bpf-linker` installations.
-   **Cleanup**: Removed legacy `actions/cache` usage for apt-lists (native disk caching is superior on self-hosted).

## [v2.1.1] - 2026-01-15

### 🛡️ LSM Hardening & Safety

Critical release hardening the BPF-LSM implementation for production readiness.

-   **Verifier Fix**: Resolved BPF verifier rejection (exit code 40) by optimizing `emit_event` (removed zeroing loop).
-   **RingBuf Safety**: Implemented secure, full-buffer copy to prevent uninitialized memory leakage to userspace.
-   **Explicit Deny**: Validated E2E `action: "deny"` enforcement (EPERM blocking).
-   **CI Gate**: Hardened `verify_lsm_docker.sh` to enforce hard failures on blocking misses.

## [v2.0.0] - 2026-01-12

### 🛡️ SOTA Hardening (Phase 5)

This major release delivers the **State-of-the-Art (SOTA)** architecture for robust runtime security, transitioning from "Best Effort" to "Forensically Sound" monitoring.

### ✨ Major Features
-   **Cgroup-First Architecture**: `assay-monitor` and `assay-ebpf` now prioritize cgroup membership over PID tracking, using `bpf_get_current_ancestor_cgroup_id` to prevent nested cgroup escapes. This ensures 100% coverage of short-lived processes.
-   **Forensic Incident Bundles**:
    -   **Secure Atomic Writes**: Implementation of `IncidentBuilder` using `openat`, `O_NOFOLLOW`, `O_EXCL`, and `renameat` to prevent TOCTOU vulnerabilities.
    -   **Unique Identity**: Incident files now use UUID v4 suffixes to guarantee uniqueness.
    -   **Detailed Metadata**: Includes kernel version, session UUID, and process tree context.
-   **eBPF Hardening**:
    -   **Dynamic Offsets**: Removed all hardcoded kernel offsets in favor of runtime resolution via `/sys/kernel/tracing/events/.../format`.
    -   **Extended Coverage**: Added `sys_enter_openat2` probe for modern kernels (Linux 5.6+).
    -   **Safety**: Uses `read_user_str_bytes` with explicit bounds checking safe slices.

### 🐛 Fixes & Polish
-   **CI Reliability**: Complete overhaul of CI pipelines using `sccache` (local backend), `mold` linker (Linux), and single-pass testing. Zero 400 errors from GH Actions Cache.
-   **Windows Support**: Fixed compilation issues in `assay-cli` by guarding Unix-specific cgroup logic.
-   **Golden Tests**: Resolved output mismatches for strict reproducibility.

## [v1.8.0] - 2026-01-11

### 🚀 Runtime Features (System 2 Security)

This release transforms Assay from a static analyzer into a complete **Runtime Security Platform**. It introduces the "System 2" capabilities: detecting and stopping dangerous behavior as it happens.

### ✨ Major Features
-   **Runtime Monitor (`assay monitor`)** *(Linux Only)*:
    -   Uses **eBPF** (extended Berkeley Packet Filter) to trace process behavior safely in kernel space.
    -   Detects file access (`openat`) and network connections (`connect`) in real-time.
    -   **Zero-Overhead**: Highly optimized "Read-First" ring buffer implementation.
-   **Discovery (`assay discover`)**:
    -   Automatically inventory running MCP servers and local configurations.
    -   Detects unmanaged servers and security gaps.
-   **Kill Switch (`assay kill`)**:
    -   Emergency termination of rogue agent processes.
    -   Supports graceful shutdown (SIGTERM) and immediate kill (SIGKILL).

### 🛡️ Hardening
-   **Native eBPF Builds**: CI now builds eBPF artifacts natively (no Docker required), ensuring determinism and stability.
-   **Host Build Protection**: The `assay-ebpf` crate is feature-gated to prevent accidental linking on non-Linux hosts.
-   **Strict Dependencies**: All upstream dependencies are strictly pinned for reproducibility.

### 📦 PyPI Metadata Fix (Real)
Updated `pyproject.toml` to explicitly use `assay-it` as the package name, ensuring `maturin` builds the correct wheel metadata for PyPI.
-   **Distribution Name**: `assay-it` (Final Fix)

## [v1.2.4] - 2026-01-05

### 📦 PyPI Package Rename
Renamed the Python SDK distribution package to `assay-it` to match the PyPI project name.
-   **Distribution Name**: `assay-it` (PyPI)
-   **Import Name**: `import assay` (Unchanged)

## [v1.2.3] - 2026-01-05

### 🩹 CI Stabilization
Patch release to resolve build pipeline issues.

-   **Fix**: Resolved artifact corruption in wheel generation (PyPI Release).
-   **Fix**: Corrected formatting in `doctor/mod.rs` to pass strict CI linting.

## [v1.2.2] - 2026-01-05

### 💅 Polish & Fixes
Strictness doesn't have to be unfriendly. This release polishes the "Strict Schema" experience.

-   **Friendly Hints**: When unknown fields are detected (e.g. `require_args`), Doctor now suggests the closest valid field ("Did you mean `require_args`?").
-   **Output**: `assay doctor` now correctly displays diagnostic messages in human-readable output (previously they were counted but hidden).
-   **Release Fix**: Removed legacy workflows to ensure smooth PyPI publishing.


## [v1.2.1-ext] - 2026-01-05

### 🩺 Smart Doctor (SOTA Agentic Edition)
Transformed `assay doctor` into a "System 2" diagnostic engine for Agentic workflows.

-   **Analyzers**:
    -   **Trace Drift**: Detects legacy `function_call` usage (recommends `tool_calls`).
    -   **Integrity**: Validates existence of all referenced policy/config files.
    -   **Logic**: Detects alias shadowing (e.g. `Search` alias hiding `Search` tool).
-   **Agentic Contract**:
    -   Output via `--format json` is strict, machine-readable, and deterministic.
    -   Includes `fix_steps` for automated self-repair.
    -   **Robust JSON Errors**: Even config parsing failures return valid JSON envelopes (when requested), ensuring Agents never crash on plain text errors.

### ⚠️ Breaking Changes (Strict Schema)
To prevent "Silent Failures" (phantom configs), we now enforce **Strict Schema Validation**:
-   **Unknown fields in `assay.yaml` or `policy.yaml` now cause a HARD ERROR.**
-   Previously, typos or incorrect nesting (e.g. `tools: ToolName:`) were silently ignored. Now you will see `E_CFG_PARSE` with "unknown field".
-   *Why*: Required for reliable Agentic generation and debugging.

### 🐛 Fixes
-   **Demo**: `assay demo` now generates canonical, schema-compliant policies.
-   **DX**: Restored `request_id` uniqueness check in trace client.

## [v1.2.0] - 2026-01-04

### 🐍 Python SDK (`assay-python-sdk`)
Native Python bindings for seamless integration into Pytest and other Python workflows.

-   **`AssayClient`**: Record traces directly from python code using `client.record_trace(obj)`.
-   **`Coverage`**: Analyze trace coverage with `assay.Coverage(policy_path).analyze(traces)`.
-   **`Explainer`**: Generate human-readable explanations of tool usage vs policy.
-   **Performance**: Built on `PyO3` + `maturin` for high-performance Rust bindings.

### 🛡️ Coverage Thresholds & Gates (`assay coverage`)
New `assay coverage` command to enforce quality gates in CI.

-   **Min Coverage**: Fail build if coverage drops below threshold (`--min-coverage 80`).
-   **Baseline Regressions**: Compare against a baseline and fail on regression (`--baseline base.json`).
-   **High Risk Gaps**: Detect and fail if critical `deny`-listed tools are never exercised.
-   **Export**: Save baselines with `--export-baseline`.

### 📉 Baseline Foundation (`assay baseline`)
Manage and track baselines to detect behavioral shifts.

-   `assay baseline record`: Capture current run metrics.
-   `assay baseline check`: Diff current run against stored baseline.
-   **Determinism**: Guaranteed deterministic output for reliable regression testing.

### Added
-   **`assay-python-sdk`** package on PyPI (upcoming).
-   `TraceExplainer` logic exposed to Python.

## [v1.1.0] - 2026-01-02

### Added

#### Policy DSL v2 - Temporal Constraints

New sequence operators for complex agent workflow validation:

- **`max_calls`** - Rate limiting per tool
  ```yaml
  sequences:
    - type: max_calls
      tool: FetchURL
      max: 10  # Deny on 11th call
  ```

- **`after`** - Post-condition enforcement
  ```yaml
  sequences:
    - type: after
      trigger: ModifyData
      then: AuditLog
      within: 3  # AuditLog must appear within 3 calls after ModifyData
  ```

- **`never_after`** - Forbidden sequences
  ```yaml
  sequences:
    - type: never_after
      trigger: Logout
      forbidden: AccessData  # Once logged out, cannot access data
  ```

- **`sequence`** - Exact ordering with strict mode
  ```yaml
  sequences:
    - type: sequence
      tools: [Authenticate, Authorize, Execute]
      strict: true  # Must be consecutive, no intervening calls
  ```

#### Aliases

Define tool groups for cleaner policies:

```yaml
aliases:
  Search:
    - SearchKnowledgeBase
    - SearchWeb
    - SearchDatabase

sequences:
  - type: eventually
    tool: Search  # Matches any alias member
    within: 5
```

#### Coverage Metrics

New `assay coverage` command for CI/CD integration:

```bash
# Check tool and rule coverage
assay coverage --policy policy.yaml --traces traces.jsonl --min-coverage 80

# Output formats: summary, json, markdown, github
assay coverage --policy policy.yaml --traces traces.jsonl --format github
```

Features:
- Tool coverage: which policy tools were exercised
- Rule coverage: which rules were triggered
- High-risk gaps: blocklisted tools never tested
- Unexpected tools: tools in traces but not in policy
- Exit codes: 0 (pass), 1 (fail), 2 (error)
- GitHub Actions annotations for PR feedback

#### GitHub Action

```yaml
- uses: assay-dev/assay-action@v1
  with:
    policy: policies/agent.yaml
    traces: traces/
    min-coverage: 80
```

#### One-liner Installation

```bash
curl -sSL https://assay.dev/install.sh | sh
```

### Changed

- Policy version bumped to `1.1`
- Improved error messages with actionable hints
- Better alias resolution performance

### Experimental

The following features are available but not yet stable:

- `assay explain` - Trace debugging and visualization (use `--experimental` flag)

### Migration from v1.0

v1.1 is fully backwards compatible with v1.0 policies. To use new features:

1. Update `version: "1.0"` to `version: "1.1"` in your policy files
2. Add `aliases` section if using tool groups
3. Add new sequence rules as needed

Existing v1.0 policies will continue to work without modification.

## [v1.0.0] - 2025-12-29
### Added
-   **Structured Logging**: `assay-core` now uses `tracing` for fail-safe events (`assay.failsafe.triggered`), enabling direct Datadog/OTLP integration.
-   **Protocol Feedback**: `assay-mcp-server` now includes a `warning` field in the response when `on_error: allow` is active and an error occurs, allowing clients to adapt logic.
-   **Documentation**: Added "Look-behind Workarounds" to `docs/guides/migration-regex.md`.

## [v1.0.0-rc.2] - 2025-12-28

### 🚀 Release Candidate 2
Rapid-response release addressing critical Design Partner feedback regarding MCP protocol compliance and operational visibility.

### ✨ Features
- **Structured Fail-Safe Logging**: Introduced `assay.failsafe.triggered` JSON event when `on_error: allow` is active, enabling machine-readable audit trails.
- **Fail-Safe UX**: Logging now occurs via standard `stderr` to avoid polluting piping outputs.

### 🐛 Fixes
- **MCP Compliance**: `assay-mcp-server` tool results are now wrapped in standard `CallToolResult` structure (`{ content: [...], isError: bool }`), enabling clients to parse error details and agents to self-correct.


### 🚀 Release Candidate 1
First Release Candidate for Assay v1.0.0, introducing the "One Engine, Two Modes" guarantee and unified policy enforcement.

### ✨ Features
- **Unified Policy Engine**: Centralized validation logic (`assay-core::policy_engine`) shared between CLI, SDK, and MCP Server.
- **Fail-Safe Configuration**: New `on_error: block | allow` settings for graceful degradation.
- **Parity Test Suite**: New `tests/parity_batch_streaming.rs` ensuring identical behavior between batch and streaming modes.
- **False Positive Suite**: `tests/fp_suite.yaml` validation for legitimate business flows.
- **Latency Benchmarks**: confirmed core decision latency <0.1ms (p95).

### 🐛 Fixes
- Resolved schema validation discrepancies between local CLI and MCP calls.
- Fixed `sequence_valid` assertions to support regex-based policy matching.

## [v0.9.0] - 2025-12-27

### 🚀 Hardened & Release Ready

This release marks the transition to a hardened, production-grade CLI. It introduces strict contract guarantees, robust migration checks, and full CI support.

### ✨ Features
- **Official CI Template**: `.github/workflows/assay.yml` for drop-in GitHub Actions support.
- **Assay Check**: New `assay migrate --check` command to guard against unmigrated configs in CI.
- **CLI Contract**: Formalized exit codes:
  - `0`: Success / Clean
  - `1`: Test Failure
  - `2`: Configuration / Migration Error
- **Soak Tested**: Validated with >50 consecutive runs for 0-flake guarantee.
- **Strict Mode Config**: `configVersion: 1` removes top-level `policies` in favor of inline declarations.

### ⚠️ Breaking Changes
- **Configuration**: Top-level `policies` field is no longer supported in `configVersion: 1`. You must run `assay migrate` to update your config.
- **Fail-Fast**: `assay migrate` and `validate` now fail hard (Exit 2) on unknown standard fields.

### 🐛 Fixes
- Fixed "Silent Drop" issue where unknown YAML fields were ignored during parsing.
- Resolved argument expansion bug in test scripts on generic shells.

## [v0.8.0] - 2025-12-27
### Added
- Soak test hardening for legacy configs
- Unit tests for backward compatibility
- `EvalConfig::validate()` method

### Changed
- Prepared `configVersion: 1` logic (opt-in)

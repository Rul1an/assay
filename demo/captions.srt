00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Your AI agent just called
a tool it shouldn't have.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Assay catches it. Exit code one.
CI blocks the deploy.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,500
Fix the policy.
Run it again.

4
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:10,000
Green. Deterministic.
Same trace, same result, every time.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Every action your agent takes becomes a signed
event in a content-addressed evidence bundle.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Explore everything interactively.
See exactly what happened.

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Merkle root, SHA-256, JCS canonicalization.
Cryptographic proof of what your agent actually did.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Attack simulation tests your gates against known vectors.
Bitflip, truncation, injection — blocked or bypassed, you'll know.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
One install. No signup.
Runs offline.

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
cargo install assay

# This file intentionally does NOT contain a private key.
#
# Previously, this fixture stored an RSA private key in PEM format
# for use by tests. Committing private keys (even test-only keys)
# can violate security policies and will trigger secret scanners.
#
# Tests that require an RSA key should generate an ephemeral keypair
# at runtime (for example, using the `rsa` crate in Rust) instead of
# reading a private key from this file.
#
# If code still reads this file, update those tests to:
#   1. Generate a keypair programmatically.
#   2. Avoid depending on this file for actual key material.
#
# This placeholder remains only to keep the path
# `tests/fixtures/test_rsa_priv.pem` valid until tests are updated.

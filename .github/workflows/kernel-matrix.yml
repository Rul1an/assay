      # This assumes the self-hosted runner has sudo NOPASSWD or runs as root-capable user.
      # The runners are expected to be booted into the target kernel via VM infra externally
      # OR this job selects a runner with that kernel.
      #
      # Since we only have one 'assay-bpf-runner' currently active (likely one kernel),
      # effectively this matrix will run twice on the SAME runner unless the runner
      # dynamically provides kernels.
      #
      # Per P1.2 requirement: "Source of Truth: Kernels booted in VM infra; jobs run on assay-bpf-runner".

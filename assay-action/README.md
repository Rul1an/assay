# Assay GitHub Action

> **Note:** This action has been moved to a separate repository for GitHub Marketplace publication.

## New Location

**Repository:** https://github.com/Rul1an/assay-action
**Marketplace:** https://github.com/marketplace/actions/assay-ai-agent-security

## Usage

```yaml
- uses: Rul1an/assay-action@v2
```

See the [new repository](https://github.com/Rul1an/assay-action) for full documentation.

## Why the Move?

GitHub Marketplace requires the `action.yml` file to be in the repository root. To provide the best developer experience and discoverability, the action now lives in its own repository.

## Legacy Support

The action in this directory (`assay/assay-action/`) is kept for reference but is no longer maintained. Please use `Rul1an/assay-action@v2` instead.
